# Overview

This program was made simply to practice data analysis using python. For this program 
I downloaded a public data set that has information from review os the dating app 
Tinder on the google play store. The program ask the user how many rows of data they
would like displayued, shows the number of 1,2,3,4, and 5 star reviews then finds the
overall average number of stars for the app based of the data. Finally the code prompts
the user for a name/word they would like to search for in the userName column. The 
program allows the user to do this as many times as they would like.
